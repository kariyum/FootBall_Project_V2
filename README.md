# FootBall_Project_V2 - First year of Computer Science after 2 years of preparatory studies - 2020/2021
We were asked to develop a desktop software using C++ that manages football competitions. This project taught us how different components behave and interact.
We presented our work after 4 months of development and we were graded 87.5/100, classed first in the university.
Side note : we used wxWidgets for the intefaces.
